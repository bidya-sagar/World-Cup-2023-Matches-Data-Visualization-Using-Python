# World-Cup-2023-Matches-Data-Visualization-Using-Python

In this project, I classified every Matches in the World Cup to be either 
significant or non-significant and then find the percentage of significant 
Matches based on the Status ,Venue, Time , Date etc for all countries that have 
played in the Cricket World Cup 2023. I then created a Web-application using 
Pandas, Numpy, Plotly ,Matplotlib, Dash Framework and then deployed the Pie, 
Bar, Scatter ,Line, Histogram ,Box .
